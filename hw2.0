# 1.Data input
First, we create a dataframe that comprised of: a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution;a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0;a character vector of length 10
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r df_create}
set.seed(1234)

hw_df = tibble(
  vec_num = rnorm(10, sd = .5),
  vec_log = vec_num>0,
  vec_char = character(10),
  vec_factor=factor(levels = c("a", "b" , "c"),10)
)
```

The mean of the variable `vec_num` is `mean(pull(hw_df, vec_num))`, 

```{r x_hist}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next we show a scatterplot of `y` vs `x`. 

```{r yx_scatter}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
